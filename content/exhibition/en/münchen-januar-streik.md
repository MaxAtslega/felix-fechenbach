Fechenbach and Eisner met in 1916. The experienced socialist spoke at the political discussion evenings organized by Fechenbach and became a central figure in the founding of the Munich local branch of the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD) in March 1917. Fechenbach also frequently took part in forbidden meetings of the USPD local branch. In January 1918 he was involved, along with Eisner, in every phase of the preparations for the strike.
