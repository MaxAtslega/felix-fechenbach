[Translated] "I appreciate that you understand that I didn't run away in March like so many others in Berlin and elsewhere. You may call that stupid. In any case, I could not do otherwise. It would have been a breach of loyalty to the Lippe workers. I would rather suffer protective custody than be called cowardly and disloyal."

In August 1933, he was driven by the SS man Paul Wiese and the SA men Walter Focke and Karl Segler to the Warburg railway station, from where he was to be transported to the Dachau concentration camp. Near Paderborn, Friedrich Gr체ttemeyer (SA) got on, stopped the car in the Kleineberg forest and asked Fechenbach about his informant for Nazi J체sken. When he did not answer, Focke and Wiese shot him - allegedly during an escape attempt. Felix Fechenbach succumbed to his injuries that very night and died in hospital. In 1966, Friedrich Gr체ttemeyer was tried in Paderborn. He was sentenced to four years in prison for accessory to murder. Walter Focke is untraceable, Paul Wiese was sentenced to five years in prison in 1948, Karl Segler could not be proven to have been involved.

"On August 7, 1933, I heard on the radio that my brother had been shot while fleeing.
On the same day, I learned in a roundabout way from the Warburg police station that my brother had died in the Scherfede hospital. That same night I drove there with my father, who had died in the meantime. I could still see my brother as a corpse. If I had not recognized my brother by the birthmark on his right hand, it would have been impossible for me to identify him. He was disfigured by ten to twelve bullet holes in all parts of his body. I took his suit and found that all the bullet holes had burn marks. On the same day I drove to the murder site in the Kleinebergerwald, on the country road between Scherfede and Rimbeck, and inspected the murder site. I found another blood spot and could tell from the impressions of the grass where my brother had collapsed. About a meter from the spot I found the casings of the bullets, as well as parts of his wristwatch. As a soldier from the First World War, I got the impression that my brother was shot at close range, on a previously selected spot, with premeditation."

"The body showed a number of injuries when I saw my brother's corpse in the morgue of the hospital at Scherfede: shear and graze wounds, bullet wounds in the head and arms, arm puncture, shot in the neck
with a large hole in the neck and a hole in the arm. The face was disfigured almost beyond recognition by blows and powerful blows. The wristwatch, or rather the watchband of the murdered man was torn to shreds and the wallet torn, all evidence of a hand-to-hand struggle and abuse preceding the shooting, during which the murdered man had resisted."
