[Translated] "I appreciate that you understand that I didn't run away in March like so many others in Berlin and elsewhere. You may call that stupid. In any case, I could not do otherwise. It would have been a breach of loyalty to the Lippe workers. I would rather suffer protective custody than be called cowardly and disloyal."

<i>Felix to Irma Fechenbach, Protective custody 1933</i>
</InformationBox>

In August 1933, he was driven by the SS man Paul Wiese and the SA men Walter Focke and Karl Segler to the Warburg railway station, from where he was to be transported to the Dachau concentration camp. Near Paderborn, Friedrich Gr체ttemeyer (SA) got on, stopped the car in the Kleineberg forest and asked Fechenbach about his informant for Nazi J체sken. When he did not answer, Focke and Wiese shot him - allegedly during an escape attempt. Felix Fechenbach succumbed to his injuries that very night and died in hospital. In 1966, Friedrich Gr체ttemeyer was tried in Paderborn. He was sentenced to four years in prison for accessory to murder. Walter Focke is untraceable, Paul Wiese was sentenced to five years in prison in 1948, Karl Segler could not be proven to have been involved.
