When Fechenbach read the job advertisement of the Detmold "Volksblatt" in a magazine of social democratic journalists in September 1929, he applied immediately. With the job as editor he found a task that filled him inwardly. He gave the social democratic newspaper a new face. In his regularly published editorials, he commented lively and well comprehensible on the events in the politics of the Reich and the country. In addition to his journalistic work, Fechenbach was soon in frequent demand as a speaker in Detmold. He took part in council meetings and numerous election campaign events. Furthermore, he enlivened the Lippean working class with his humanly authentic and rhetorically quick-witted manner. Already at the beginning of the 1930s Fechenbach attracted the hatred of the National Socialists. He invented the figure of the "Nazi Jüsken", who blabbed many an internal NSDAP matter in the "Volksblatt". The National Socialists reacted angrily to this and slandered the Social Democratic, Jewish editor in the "Lippischer Kurier". In January 1933, Fechenbach was called a "stain on the nation" and a "Jewish convict".
