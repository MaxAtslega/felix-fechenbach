Fechenbach had not lost his ideals in the prison. His position at Dietz Verlag enabled him to continue his political and journalistic skills. He wrote down his memories of the prison and of his time with Kurt Eisner. At the same time, he worked for the daily and evening editions of the social democratic newspaper "Vorw√§rts". Fechenbach wrote social reportages in which he depicted conditions in the structurally weak areas of the Reich. He was a member of the district executive of the Socialist Workers' Youth (SAJ) in Berlin and was involved in the SPD's youth association, the Kinderfreunde movement. There he met his second wife, Irma Epstein, a nurse and state-certified welfare nurse. The two led a happy marriage. Irma shared her husband's political views and supported him in his work.
