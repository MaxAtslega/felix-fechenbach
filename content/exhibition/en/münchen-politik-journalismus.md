Back in Munich, Fechenbach turned entirely to journalism. His articles were well researched and written with a sure sense of style. But politics also continued to play an important role in his life. He was so involved in both areas that his marriage to Martha broke down as a result. From the beginning, his wife had expected Fechenbach to establish himself socially and professionally. Thus two ideas of life clashed that could not be reconciled. The marriage was divorced on 27 February 1922.
