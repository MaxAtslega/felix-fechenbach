Fechenbach was arrested in August 1922 on the basis of a nine-page libel statement by his divorced wife. In it, she described Fechenbach's political and journalistic work from her aggrieved point of view and denigrated him and many people from his close circle. Fechenbach's opponents took advantage of this statement: they sued him for treason. Two years earlier, Fechenbach had already published documents proving German complicity in the outbreak of the First World War. The young democratic socialist had thus attracted the hatred of many German nationalists.
