After the collapse of the Munich soviet republic, Fechenbach left Munich and resigned from the USPD. He went with his wife to Leipzig and from there into exile in Aussig. In this way he evaded a trial that was to be brought against him on the basis of files related to the political upheavals of the soviet republic. In Aussig he took over the editorship of the social democratic workers' newspaper "Volksrecht" and wrote in it under the pseudonym "Rudolf Franke". He became politically involved by holding meetings in local factories. At the beginning of November he was arrested on the train to Dresden and shortly afterwards there was a trial: Felix Fechenbach was - once again - acquitted.
