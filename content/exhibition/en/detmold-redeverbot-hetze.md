At the beginning of 1933, the whole of Lippe was dominated by the upcoming elections. On 15 January, the NSDAP was elected the strongest party in the Lippe state parliament. But the Social Democrats and the Communists also gained votes. Nevertheless, the "Lippische Kurier" celebrated the National Socialists and their leader with the headline: "Hitler wins in Lippe!". Two weeks later, the National Socialists, led by Adolf Hitler, took power in Berlin and the mood turned in Detmold as well. In the following months, Fechenbach was repeatedly ridiculed in the "Lippischer Kurier" and had to endure invective in the streets. On 5 March he was attacked and beaten up by four SA men. After many warnings, he had taken his family to safety shortly before. The "Volksblatt" had been banned on 3 March. Fechenbach remained in Detmold, although he had been banned from speaking at public events and sworn to secrecy at SPD members' meetings.

[Translated] "Whoever knows the mood in the country knows that there is an unhealthy agitation about the fact that the Jew Fechenbach is still allowed to shoot his poisoned arrows into the hearts of the German workers, knows also that the Fechenbach case in Lippe is not yet settled..."
