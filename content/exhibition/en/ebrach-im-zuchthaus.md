The People's Court in Munich sentenced Fechenbach to eleven years in prison for treason. From the beginning, the trial was used by Fechenbach's political opponents primarily to accuse him of "fatherlessness" and to publicly pillory him as a "representative scapegoat" for both the Munich Revolution and the "war guilt lie". The fact that people's courts were illegal according to the Reich Constitution of 14 August 1919, but that the Fechenbach case was nevertheless tried there, was not questioned by anyone at the time. Only when the pressure from outside increased - the Fechenbach case had caused discussion in parliament as well as in the liberal and social democratic public - were his prison conditions eased. He was allowed to read some newspapers and given a writing book. When Adolf Hitler, sentenced to five years' imprisonment in a fortress for high treason, was released early from prison on 20 December 1924 for good behaviour, Fechenbach's time in prison also ended. He travelled to his parents in Nuremberg.
