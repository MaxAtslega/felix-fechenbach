Fechenbach had to spend the first night in Ebrach penitentiary in an iron cage and lived under a lot of pressure for the next 26 months: in solitary confinement and under strict control of his correspondences. In addition, he was initially prohibited from reading newspapers, writing letters and owning books.

"The cage door is opened and I am told to enter. At first I think it's a crude joke they're trying to play on me. But it is brutally serious. "You want me to go in there?" I ask, still quite incredulous. The officer answers in the affirmative. As he does so, he twirls his martial black moustache. "This is like a tiger's cage!" [...] I walk up and down. With three steps I have measured the small room and have to turn back again and again. Involuntarily, I think of predator cages in menageries, in which caged animals restlessly brush back and forth against the bars."

<h2>Iron cage</h2>
The history of the iron cage goes back to the Middle Ages. In its function as an instrument of torture, the cage often hung on a stand made of wood. The prisoner was locked in the cage - usually naked. Depending on the punishment, he had to spend several hours or even several days and nights in it.
