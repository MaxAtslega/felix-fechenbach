From the end of 1915, Felix Fechenbach led a "double life". Compared to his family, he was the well-behaved son, who was only concerned with the everyday worries of a non-commissioned officer on home duty. At the same time he got involved again in the work of the youth section of the SPD in Munich, which he had founded himself.

<strong>First World War (1914 - 1918)</strong>
<br/>
From August 1914 Germany and Austria-Hungary were at war with France, England and Russia. Many Germans soon suffered from hunger, were disappointed by the sluggish course of the war and shocked by the mass killings on the western front. The First World War ended in November 1918 with Germany's military defeat.

[Translated] "Dear Parents! I'm still in quarters behind the western front! What mail have you already received from me? I haven't gotten anything yet. First of all, send me cigarettes, namely Manoli [Pandy]. â€“ Is Berti at home already? How is he? - Let's hear something soon and receive greetings from your Felix"
